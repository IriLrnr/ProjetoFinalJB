  abstract = {The question of why biological diversity is spread in characteristic patterns is perhaps the biggest problem in ecology. In recent years, the 'neutral theory' of biodiversity has modelled the distribution of species in a very simple way, without reference to species interactions or history. Sexual reproduction, mutation and dispersal are now introduced to the simulation of populations; the resulting predictions correlate well with real data sets.},
